This repository contains testing simulations of NASA SLI rockets. These simulations are performed in Python using the `ORLab` library, which uses the OpenRocket rocket simulation software as its backend.

In the `Fin Testing` folder, you will find the OpenRocket file `NASA 25-26 Proposal Rocket.ork`, which contains the preliminary design for the rocket. I suggest downloading this file, since I will be editing this file and it may cause some conflicting changes. You can open this file in OpenRocket to view and modify the rocket design.
